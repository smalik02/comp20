README for Lab4

To my knowledge, I have implemented everything correctly. I was unable to test the responsive image on resolution above
1400px because my brower did not support that. I did test all of the other images by changing the size of the window.
In addition, I used 187px for the height of the gif after dividing 560 by 3, i.e. I rounded up.

I spent around 1.5hrs on the lab.

I asked questions on Piazza and Ming was very helpful. In addition, I used stack overflow as a resource.
