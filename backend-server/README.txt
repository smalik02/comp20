Implementation:
	To my knowledge, I have implemented everything correctly. I tested
	all of the APIs without having my database running in my terminal
	by using postman, and it produced the correct output. I believe it
	should be working from any other domain as well!
Acknowledgements:
	Piazza was very helpful as always. Furthermore, Sophie helped me out
	a little bit as well.
Time:
	I spent around 4 hours working on this hw, and most of it was debugging
	and setting up mongodb.
