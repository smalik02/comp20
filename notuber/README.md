Comp20 - Assignment 2
README

To my knowledge, I have implemented everything correctly. I am positive that my code is implemented such that it can handle
both the passengers and vehicles data from the database.

I did not work with anyone else on this assignment. I used the example from class, and Google Maps' API examples to finish
the assignment. Google Maps API guide was very helpful, along with Mings own examples to start off.

I spent around 3 - 4 hours on this assignment, evenly throughout a couple of weeks.
