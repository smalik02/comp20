### Why Git?
- This Github repository serves as a place to hold all of my work for the semester. All of the assignments, except assignment 3, can be found in this repo. This repo is more or less a showcase for my work in Comp-20

### Favorite Assignment
- My favorite assignment was assignment #3. Coming into COMP-20, I had done a fair amount of work with front-end / client-side work (HTML/CSS, JavaScript, etc) so this assignment was my first real work with back-end development. Because of this, assignment #3 was probably the most rewarding assignment because it was on completely new material and gave me an opportunity to work with this new content. I also spent the most time on this assignment as it was challenging. In the end, I had a bug where I was testing my code on a local machine, instead of running it off of localhost, and I thought that I had enabled CORS; however, after talking to Ming, clearly I had not! After finishing the assignment, I feel like I have a much better, but definitely not a perfect, understanding of how servers actually work.


### How have I grown?
- Throughout all of COMP-20, I think I have grown substantially. Coming into the class, I had previous web programming experience (HTML/CSS & JS/jQuery) but this was my first class where I was applying the concepts. I was able to learn even more about the basic concepts that I knew before coming into the class. I never would have expected to leave this class knowing so much about so many different things, but I am very glad that I am. I also appreciated Ming's examples of how to solve the problem. The homeworks definitely built upon them, but they were a great starting point. It allowed me to examine the code and determine why it works the way it does, thus leading to a better understanding of the material.

### Most important thing I learned
- The most important thing that I learned in this class was the use of tools like Git/Github, Homebrew, and Curl. All of these tools were things that I had previously heard about and done minor fiddling with. However, it wasn't until this class that I fully learned the full power of these tools. I am no where near an expert, in any of these tools and especially with GIT, but I feel confident talking about and using Git, Homebrew, and Curl.

### Next Steps
- I would love to continue doing work in back-end development. This side of web programming was always unknown to me previous to this class, and now that I have had an introduction to the material, I would love to do even more with it. I am going to work on learning more about server side development, and hopefully take Comp120 when it is offered. I also want to continue learning more about the client-side development by exploring different and unique ways of designing UIs, etc.
